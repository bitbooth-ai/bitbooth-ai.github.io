# BitBooth: Marketing Copy for Investment Professionals

## Target Audience
Investment partners and investment professionals at Nordic family offices and boutique PE firms (€500M-€5B AUM) who can make decisions about engaging AI advisory services.

## Core Psychological Insight
Decision-makers evaluate consultants the same way they evaluate investments: **risk-adjusted returns with clear optionality.** They need to feel the risk is low enough to justify a trial.

## Hero Messaging

### Primary Headline Options

**Option A (Problem-Aware):**
> "Your peers are using AI. You're not sure where to start."

**Option B (Credibility-Led):**
> "AI expertise for Nordic investment firms. Built at €142B scale."

**Option C (Low-Risk Entry):**
> "Senior AI advisory. €2,500/quarter. No long-term commitment."

### Supporting Subheadline
> "A fractional AI advisor for when you need expert judgment—without project overhead, vendor lock-in, or consultancy theater."

---

## Low-Risk Value Proposition

### The Core Message
Investment professionals hesitate because they've seen expensive consulting engagements that produce slides, not results. They need to know:

1. **The entry cost is trivial** relative to their AUM
2. **The exit is easy** if it doesn't work
3. **The upside is clear** and tangible

### Framing for "Try It Out" Mindset

**The €2,500/Quarter Pitch:**
> "That's less than a single day of Big 4 rates. Most clients find one insight per quarter that saves multiples of the fee—a vendor they didn't waste time on, a portfolio company request they could evaluate properly."

**The Trial Relationship:**
> "Think of it as a trial relationship. If it's valuable after three months, we continue. If not, we part ways. No hard feelings, no long-term lock-in."

**The Risk Reversal:**
> "3-month minimum commitment. Auto-renews unless you opt out with 30 days notice. You're always in control."

## "Sound Familiar?" Recognition Moments

These statements make prospects feel understood:

1. **"Vendors pitch AI-powered platforms—you can't evaluate if the technology is real or marketing."**

2. **"Partners heard peers mention AI wins—you don't know if those wins apply to your firm."**

3. **"A portfolio company requests €500K for data infrastructure—you need someone to tell you if that's reasonable."**

4. **"Compliance asks about AI risk—you're not sure what the policy should say."**

5. **"IT manages infrastructure, but not AI strategy—different expertise required."**

## Objection-Handling Copy

**"€2,500 seems like a lot for some phone calls"**
> "It's less than a single day of Big 4 rates. The value is having access when you need it—not maximizing utilization."

**"What if we don't use it?"**
> "Some quarters are quiet, some are busy. If you consistently don't have questions, that might mean you don't need this—and I'll tell you that."

**"We're not sure we have enough questions"**
> "Let's try one quarter. If after three months you haven't found it valuable, don't renew. No hard feelings."

**"Can we just do hourly as-needed?"**
> "I've found that creates friction—you hesitate to call because every question 'costs money.' The retainer means you call when you should, not when you've accumulated enough."

---

## Trust-Building Statements

**Honesty Commitment:**
> "Roughly 30% of assessments conclude that the firm's current scale doesn't justify AI investment. We'll tell you that. Our incentive is your trust over 10 years, not one follow-on project."

**No Lock-In Guarantee:**
> "Full knowledge transfer. You own the IP, the documentation, and the capability. My job is to work myself out of a job."

**Senior Delivery Promise:**
> "You work directly with a principal-level practitioner. No bait-and-switch with junior consultants."

- Be direct about what this is and isn't

### Don't:

- Sound like a vendor pitch
- Pressure or create urgency artificially
- Hide pricing or require "let's discuss"
