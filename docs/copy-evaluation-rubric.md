# BitBooth Website Copy Evaluation Rubric

## Purpose
This rubric is used to evaluate and score the marketing copy on BitBooth website designs. The target audience is **investment partners and investment professionals at Nordic family offices and boutique PE firms** who make decisions about engaging AI advisory services.

## Scoring Scale
Each criterion is scored 1-5:
- **1 = Poor** — Does not meet criterion at all
- **2 = Below Average** — Partially meets criterion with significant gaps
- **3 = Average** — Meets basic expectations
- **4 = Good** — Exceeds expectations in most areas
- **5 = Excellent** — Fully meets criterion with distinction

## Minimum Passing Score
- Individual criterion: 3 or higher
- Overall average: 3.5 or higher
- **If any criterion scores below 3, copy should be rewritten**

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Target Audience Alignment (Weight: 25%)

**Question:** Does the copy speak directly to investment professionals at Nordic family offices and PE firms?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Explicitly references investment firms, AUM, deal flow, portfolio monitoring, PE/family office contexts |
| 4 | Clearly targets B2B financial services with relevant terminology |
| 3 | Generic B2B professional services language that could apply |
| 2 | Tech-focused language that doesn't resonate with investment professionals |
| 1 | Consumer-focused or irrelevant industry targeting |

**Look for:**
- Investment-specific terms (AUM, deal sourcing, diligence, portfolio, IC)
- Nordic/European market references
- Appropriate firm size references (€500M-€5B)
- Understanding of investment firm structure (Managing Partner, COO, deal team)

| 5 | Clear pricing, easy exit, trial mindset, explicit risk reversal |
| 4 | Pricing visible, commitment levels clear, low-pressure tone |
| 3 | Some indication of commitment level, moderately approachable |
| 2 | Vague on pricing/commitment, feels like a sales pitch |
| 1 | No pricing, high-pressure language, or no clear entry point |

**Look for:**
- Visible pricing (€2,500/quarter, €35K-50K, etc.)
- "No long-term commitment" or similar
- Trial/exploratory language
- Easy exit messaging

| 4 | Strong credentials with some specific numbers |
| 3 | General credibility statements without specifics |
| 2 | Vague claims ("years of experience", "proven results") |

| 4 | Relevant business problems clearly articulated |
| 3 | Generic pain points that somewhat apply |

## Rewrite Guidelines

When rewriting copy that scores below threshold:

1. **Reference the marketing copy document** at `/docs/investment-marketing-copy.md`
2. **Preserve design structure** — only change text content, not HTML/CSS
3. **Prioritize low-scoring criteria** — fix the worst scores first
4. **Maintain brand voice** — confident, direct, peer-to-peer
5. **Keep specific numbers** — never remove quantified proof points
6. **Test against rubric** — ensure rewrite scores 3.5+ before committing
